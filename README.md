# TTGameShow

A Javascript game that allows the users to guess a phrase by typing or clicking one letter at time.  

## Background
The origianal UI was created by the [TeamTreeHouse.com](http://teamtreehouse.com) curriculum developers.   Students were then asked to create the Javascript that would add functionality to the game.     

## GamePlay
The Game begins when the user clicks the start game button.  A random phrase is then selected from a pool of phrases.

## Adjustment to the Design
The Color of the win and lose backgrounds were changed from their original colors.  Button colors were also adjusted to another color.
