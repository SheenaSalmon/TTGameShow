# TTGameShow

An Javascript game that allows the users to guess a phrase by typing or clicking one letter at time.  

## Background
The origianal UI was created by the TeamTreeHouse.com curriculum developers.   Students were then asked to create the Javascript that would add functionality to the game.     


## Adjustment to the Design
The Color of the win and lose backgrounds were changed from their original colors.  Button colors were also adjusted to another color.
